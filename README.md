# Off the Record

Revamp of a 2016 hackathon project - [original repository here](https://github.com/vishnuravi/off-the-record-nyphack)

As a teen, itâ€™s embarrassing and awkward to openly ask your doctor questions about things like drugs, alcohol, sex, etc. when your parents are in the room. These conversations reveal risk factors that lead to accidents and suicide, the two biggest killers in the adolescent population.

This project allows teens to text a number specific to their doctor which sends them back a link to a secure messaging app where they can enter in the question or concern they have for their doctor privately and securely. The message is then delivered to the doctor and erased completely from the teen's phone. There is no app to install or data stored on the phone that can be tracked.
